Domain names are organized in hierarchies. Actual: DNS consists of a hierarchical domain
scheme and a distributed database system to
implement this naming scheme For Internet Infrastructure – one domain: .arpa ARPA (Address
and Routing Parameter Area)
Pseudo-domains: .bitnet, .local, .root, .uucp etc. – The physical topology is not taken into
consideration Each domain controls how its subdomains are
assigned DNS To create a new subdomain, permissions are
requested from the upper domain (each domain
will have an authority at a certain level) The naming domain is performed in respect to the
organizational boundaries, not those of networks – Theoretically, a single name server can contain the
entire DNS database and can respond to all
requests There is a primary/authoritative name server that
manages a certain domain, and possibly, more
secondary servers contain replicated databases Example of name server implementations:
BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Domain),
MSDNS, PowerDNS etc. – Recursive – if a DNS server does not know the
address for the requested name, then it will query
another DNS server – Incremental – if the DNS server does not know how
to respond, it will return an error and another DNS
server address (also called referral) that may know
the answer to the query If we have an address, which will be its symbolic
name? (reverse DNS resolution or reverse DNS
lookup) We do not have to develop a resolver in order to find
out the IP address of a host Usage example: setting a symbolic name instead of an IP address
in a sockaddr_in structure:
struct sockaddr_in server;
struct hostent *hos;
if(!( hos = gethostbyname(“fenrir.info.uaic.ro”) )
{/*Error on resolving address*/}
server.sin_family=AF_INET;
/* we take the IP address from hos structure */
memcpy(&server.sin_addr.s_addr, hos->h_addr_list[0],
sizeof(hos->h_addr_list));
server.sin_port=htons(4321);
Return value: On success, it returns a pointer to hostent, which
contains the official name of the host; On error, it returns NULL,
and h_errno variable indicates the error Cases when we can have multiple structures:
– If a hostname has multiple IP addresses, then a structure is
returned for each one
– If the service is offered for different types of sockets, then a
structure in returned for each type of socket DNS root is officially administered by
Internet Corporation for Assigned Names
and Numbers (ICANN)
There are other organizations that offer
alternative roots, like OpenNIC (Network
Information Center) or New.Net
