## The problem

The internet is loaded with so many documents, from which not all have proven to be either good enough or understandable, it then becomes confusing for students to pick one to start with - they end up surrendering.

Let's say one student - call him Mike - didn't make it to the Graphs lecture one day and he decides to have a look at the notes by himself. However, the lecture PDF presentation doesn't seem to help very much, since it doesn't contain the full explanations of concepts - only brief notes, some formulae and schemas Mike doesn't really understand.

He wants to have a better image of what _planar graphs_ are and how they work. On a fast Google search, Mike gets ~5.140.000 results in less than half a second. 5 _million_ results. Where to begin? First result is from _Wikipedia_. Click.

style="width: 90%; height: 100%" />

Mike has no idea what this means. Mike needs more beginner-like content. Mike is very confused. Mike then sees this image - it's a _Schlegel diagram of a regular dodecahedron, forming a planar graph from a convex polyhedron_:

Mike doesn't like it very much and eventually gives up.

## The idea

_Recommend ME_ was thought to be a tool designed for the Computer Science students in order for them to deepen their knowledge in the more "abstract" fields by offering them good, readable, external resources for documentation.

## How it works

_Recommend ME_ uses NLP in order to analyze either lecture notes or descriptions of them so as to find references in the top profile books, offering students precise coordinates of where to search for the information they need.
